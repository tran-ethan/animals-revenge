# Animal's Revenge

Animal’s revenge is an immersive interactive graphical physics simulator centered around
projectile motion. Upon startup, users are greeted by a home screen with a variety of
buttons and menus, determining where they want to go and what they want to do. The
main idea is to get users to launch a projectile at a structure that was built with a drag
and drop system allowing users to have invoke their creativity and design unique structures.
Through this potent user-interface, users will be able to easily choose between animals and
objects to launch. The user will also be prompted to choose different launchers to create a
more unique experience for each user. The customization in this simulation is what will take
it above and beyond similar applications. Moreover, the application will act as a learning
medium in which users can experiment with projectile motion. This will be made possible
with the various parameterWindow and customization ability the users will have. For instance,
users will be able to change the launch angle of the projectile. This change will influence the
path of the projectile thus enabling users to recognize the results of such parameterWindow. The
application will be comprised of many parameter trackers. These statistics will be enhanced
with live graphs that track the motion as it is in the air. These details are important as it
allows the user to understand and interpret what is on their screen.

## Goals

In accomplishing this project, our team is hoping to:

- **Educate**. Our project’s main objective is to help our users understand physics related
  concepts, predominantly projectile motion, and collisions, by allowing them to visualize
  the applied concepts in a graphical environment.
- **Simulate**. By enabling the user to choose the different factors of the thrown projectile,
  such as angle of launch, along with the complete freedom for the structure building, as
  long as it follows the laws of physics, the users will be able to create an almost infinite
  number of scenarios. This will enable them to understand the impact of the different
  factors present in the experiment.
- **Engage**. By implementing game-like features along with a lot of interactive parameterWindow,
  we make sure that the users are entertained throughout their learning experience.
  This will make them stay longer on our platform and learn even more about the subject.

## Features

Animal’s will offer a wide range of features to demonstrate a physical reaction of object on
each other in 2 dimensions:

- Projectile motion simulation in 2D : Users will be able to simulate projectile motion by
  launching different projectiles at buildings. This will be done by projecting kinematic
  equations on Ox and Oy plane, taking into account factors like initial velocity, angle
  of projection, and gravity.
- Newton's third laws of motion:
  - Law of Inertia(Launched object maintain their velocity until affected by gravity
    or collisions.)
  - Law of Force and Acceleration(_F = ma_; It will calculate and display the forces
    and accelerations)
  - Action-Reaction Pairs( It will not let the object to enter in other object and will
    provide with realistic collision)
- Drag-and-Drop building customization: Users can create custom structures by selecting,
  dragging, and placing different building blocks on the screen. Will include a variety
  of object, including walls, platforms, blocks, obstacles, etc.
- Projectile Selection: Multiple different animals and objects will be offered as projectiles.
  The will all have their unique masses, sizes, etc.
- Parameter customization: Application will provide all necessary tools for modifying
  and changing:
  - Initial launch direction (angle)
  - Initial speed
  - Projectile mass
  - Projectile size
  - Force of gravity
  - Air resistance (drag), and wind speed
  - Size of building blocks
  - Mass of building blocks
- Save and load: Allow users to save their simulation state and reload it. Will be able
  to store user-designed structures for future use as well as a variety of built-in scenarios
  with various preset parameterWindow and buildings.
- Additional UX features: modifying background image (look and feel), interface color,
  design, style, small micro-interactions (button hovers, clicks), loading skeletons, etc.
- Sound: Will include a soundscape for different scenarios in addition
